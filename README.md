# Scavenger Hunt Smart Contract

## Vision

The Scavenger Hunt smart contract aims to create an engaging and interactive blockchain-based game where users can submit valid keys to track their progress. The game is designed to ensure users submit unique keys to achieve milestones, enhancing both the fun and challenge of the scavenger hunt.

## Project Features

- **Key Submission**: Users can submit keys to progress in the scavenger hunt. Each key is hashed and checked against a predefined set of valid keys.
- **Unique Key Tracking**: Only unique keys are counted towards user progress. Repeated submissions of the same key are not allowed and will not affect progress.
- **Progress Tracking**: The contract tracks how many unique valid keys a user has submitted. Users can query their progress at any time.
- **Validity Check**: Users can verify if a key is valid before submitting it, ensuring they are working with the correct keys.
- **Gas Efficiency**: The contract is optimized to reduce gas costs associated with key submissions and progress tracking.

## Future Scope

- **Dynamic Key Management**: Extend the contract to allow dynamic addition or removal of valid keys.
- **User Leaderboards**: Implement a leaderboard system to showcase top performers based on the number of unique keys submitted.
- **Enhanced User Interaction**: Develop a front-end interface with additional features such as user profiles, achievement badges, and real-time notifications.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Expand the contract to support deployment on multiple blockchains or Layer 2 solutions for scalability and reduced costs.
- **Smart Contract Upgrades**: Implement upgradeable smart contract patterns to allow future enhancements and improvements without losing existing data.
